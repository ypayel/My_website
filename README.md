## 🧭 Project Overview

This website serves as my **personal portfolio**, presenting 15 different web projects — ranging from simple MVPs and frontend layouts to advanced full-stack applications with API and Redis integration.  

Each project demonstrates different aspects of web development: UI design, state management, responsive layouts, API handling, and backend logic.  

The portfolio was built using **React, Vite, and SCSS**, with some projects also involving **TypeScript** and **Node.js** for backend functionality.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **React** – main frontend framework  
- **Vite** – fast build tool and development server  
- **SCSS (Sass)** – modular styling with variables and mixins  
- **TypeScript** – used in backend projects for strong typing  
- **Redis** – caching and real-time data management (Project 14)  
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)**  
- **Vercel** – for deployment and hosting  
- **Git / GitHub** – version control and collaboration
